# SalesVision Dashboard

SalesVision is a sales analytics dashboard I built using Flask and Vanilla JS. The goal was to create a clean, modern interface to visualize sales data from a SQLite database and simulate a real-time activity feed.

## Features

- **Real-Time Activity Feed**: The dashboard simulates live sales events (like new orders or signups) on the fly, so you can see the interface update in real-time.
- **Interactive Charts**:
    - Revenue by Region (Bar Chart)
    - Profit by Category (Doughnut Chart)
    - Top 10 Customers (Horizontal Bar Chart)
- **Key Metrics**: Displays Total Revenue, Profit, and Average Order Value at a glance.
- **Alerts**: A dedicated section to highlight loss-making orders that might need attention.
- **Design**: I used a "Shadcn" inspired light theme with a white background and subtle borders for a professional look.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask), SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Chart.js
- **Deployment**: Configured for Vercel (Serverless)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python 3.x installed.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhiii47/SalesVision.git
    cd SalesVision
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Seed the database with dummy data:
    ```bash
    python seed_data.py
    ```

4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5.  Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see it running.

## Deployment on Vercel

This project is set up to work easily with Vercel.

1.  Push this code to your GitHub.
2.  Import the project in Vercel.
3.  It should deploy automatically using the included `vercel.json` configuration.

*Note: Since Vercel's filesystem is read-only, the SQLite database will be read-only in production, and the live activity feed generates mock data dynamically.*

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application.
- `seed_data.py`: Script to generate the initial random data for the database.
- `static/`: Contains the CSS and JavaScript files.
- `templates/`: Contains the HTML layout.
- `sales.db`: The SQLite database (generated by the seed script).
